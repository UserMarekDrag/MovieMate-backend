# MovieMade
Welcome to MovieMate, a one-stop solution for movie enthusiasts in Poland. MovieMate offers an interface where users can select their city and date to view all available movie showtimes, along with links for reservations. By scraping data daily from the websites of two of the largest cinemas in Poland, Multikino and Helios, we keep our information up-to-date and comprehensive. More cinemas will be added over time as we continue to expand the functionality of our site.


### Features

- Movie Showtimes: Users can enter their city and date to view all movie showtimes from all cinemas in that city. The application provides detailed information about each showtime and includes links for additional details.

- Data Scraping: The application utilizes Python scripts with BeautifulSoup (bs4) and Selenium to scrape data. Once a day, the scraper executes tasks using RabbitMQ and Celery, gathering showtime information for all cities, cinemas, and corresponding dates. The data is then saved into the application's models.

- API Management: The movie_api module manages the API views using Django Rest Framework (DRF) and the filter module to process requests from the frontend. It ensures the appropriate data is passed to the frontend queries and records information about the retrieved data for analysis and further application development.

- User Management: The user_api module handles user and superuser creation. It enables the addition of new features as the application evolves.

### Backend Repository
The backend repository contains the server-side code for the MovieMade application. It uses Python and Django to handle API requests and communicate with the PostgreSQL database.

### Prerequisites
Before running the backend, make sure you have the following installed:

- Docker
- Docker Compose
