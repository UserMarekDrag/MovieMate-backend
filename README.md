# MovieMade
MovieMade is a web application for managing and organizing movie collections. The project is divided into separate repositories for the backend and frontend components, utilizing Python, Django, MySQL for the backend, and React for the frontend.

## Backend Repository
The backend repository contains the server-side code for the MovieMade application. It uses Python and Django to handle API requests and communicate with the MySQL database.

### Prerequisites

### Installation
To install the backend:

1. Clone the backend repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the backend directory.
3. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended).
4. Install the dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
5. Set up the MySQL database with appropriate credentials in settings.py.
6. Run the migrations to create the necessary tables using python manage.py migrate.
7. Start the Django development server using python manage.py runserver.
8. The backend API will now be running at http://localhost:8000/.

### API Endpoints
The backend provides the following API endpoints for the frontend to interact with:

- /api/movies: CRUD operations for managing movies.
