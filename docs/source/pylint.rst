Pylint Report
=============

We use Pylint in our project as an automated tool for checking code quality. Proper usage of the tool helps to maintain the high quality of our code and adheres to the PEP 8 Python coding standards.

Configuration
-------------

Our configuration rules are defined in the `.pylintrc` file located in the root directory of the project. The configuration currently contains the following settings:

.. code-block:: text

    [MASTER]
    load-plugins=pylint_django
    ignore=migrations

    [MESSAGES CONTROL]
    disable=
        no-member,
        missing-module-docstring,
        arguments-renamed,
        abstract-class-instantiated,
        arguments-differ

    [FORMAT]
    max-line-length=120

    [DESIGN]
    max-locals=20
    max-args=6

    [CLASSES]
    max-public-methods=7
    min-public-methods=1

    [pylint_django]
    django-settings-module=moviemate.settings

These settings allow us to adapt Pylint to the specific needs of our Django project and customize its behavior according to our requirements.
